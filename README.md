# Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) Projects

This repository contains various projects and implementations focused on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), one of the most powerful tools in deep learning, particularly for image classification tasks.

## Projects Overview

### 1. Pizza vs. Steak Classification
- **Description:** A binary image classification project using a modified version of the Food101 dataset to distinguish between pizza üçï and steak ü•© images.
- **Dataset:** [Food101 dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dansbecker/food-101), modified using the [Image Data Modification Notebook](https://github.com/mrdbourke/tensorflow-deep-learning/blob/main/extras/image_data_modification.ipynb).
- **Notebook:** `Introduction_to_computer_vision_with_tensorflow.ipynb`
